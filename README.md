# BudgetReboot
Okay, starting a personal budget application to get a better understanding of Django

This project, admittedly, may not use the best of practices and is more of a quick and dirty tour of Django. I am not worried about 
full test coverage (I just want to test drive the testing framework), scalable design, or other considerations of a commercial application. I may revisit it someday to clean it up, or 
use is as a spring board for a new version.
